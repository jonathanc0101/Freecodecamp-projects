                If the quote is true, then all programmers are great artists. We live in an age of stackoverflow and copy-paste. Altough this wasn't copy paste per se, I did not come up with any of the building blocks that made this website, that's the work of much, much smarter people than me. The people that invented HTML, CSS, javascript, etc. I just made the blocks fit in a way that looked nice to me.

                    <p>This is my first web form, discovering the powerful aspect of padding in an input opened my eyes. It sounds funny but it's true, before doing this all I could imagine when i tought of an user interface in a form was some old grey-looking Windows form from the early 2000's.</p>
