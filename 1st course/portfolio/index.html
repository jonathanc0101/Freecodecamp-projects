                        That's the 2010's and onwards programmers lema, we live in an age of stackoverflow and copy-paste. Altough this wasn't copy paste per se, I did not come up with any of the building blocks that made this website, that's the work of much, much smarter people than me. I just made the blocks fit in a way that looked nice to me.

                        It really helped me to get in the mindset that I was an employee of that company(even tough I was not). I even probably broke a few laws linking to their images and stealing the whole concept of the product.

                    <p>This is my first web form, discovering the powerful aspect of padding in an input opened my eyes. It sounds funny but it's true, before doing this all I could imagine when i tought of an user interface in a form was some old grey-looking Windows form from the early 2000's.</p>

                    <p>It's not really a tribute, I say some facts that do not leave his image pristine to say the least. I also say that he was a product of his time, make of this what you will.</p>
